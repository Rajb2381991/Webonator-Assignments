/*
4. Collect information from the user and store in a variable for later user.
o Create a basic page in HTML.
o Using a prompt box, prompt the user to supply his or her name.
o Save the name in a variable.
o Then, using a document.write() statement, use the information stored in variables
to display Hello username! in big, bold letters, i.e. surrounded by <h1> tags.
o username should, of course, be what the user actually typed into the prompt box.
Using the same variable, also, display Hello username! in an alert message on the same
page.
Final result: When the page loads, the user is prompted for his or her name. That name is
then immediately displayed as Hello username! in an alert message, and then
should immediately display as Hello username! in the page.
