/*
5. Create a "Mad-libs" game using JavaScript.
 Create a blank page.
 Using a prompt box, prompt the user to supply his or her name.
 Then, using 5 additional prompt boxes, prompt the user to supply 5 words.
 Save each word in a separate variable.
 Then, using document.write() statements, use the information stored in variables to display
a "Mad-libs" type of story, i.e. create a few paragraphs of information in story format.
 Also, prompt the user for a color (i.e. one of the 16 named colors or a hex value).
 Store this color in a variable.
 In the "mad libs" story, highlight, using the color supplied by the user, each of the words that
you previously collected. Do this by surrounding the words with <div> tags and using an
inline style.
